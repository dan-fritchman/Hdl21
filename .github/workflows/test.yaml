    # Notes on this matrix, particularly the dependencies part:
    # Hdl21 has two external dependencies: Pydantic and VLSIR.
    # 
    # 1. VLSIR
    # This sets up testing with dependencies from both (a) PyPi and (b) "dev" versions from GitHub.
    # Not every version of Hdl21 is designed to work with both.
    # Eventually this should know which *should* work.
    # For now it asserts that the dev-mode passes, and allows failer (`continue-on-error`) for the PyPi version.
    # 
    # 2. Pydantic
    # Test with both the minimum supported version, and whatever pip selects, which is generally the latest.
    # Some languages/ libraries (ahem, Rust) find a way to build in this "test them min supported version" thing;
    # we haven't seen one for Python, and can only really do this "manually" because there is only one. 
    # Note the combinations pf `python-version` and `pydantic-version` are often relevant;
    # typing-stuff generally evolves materially with each python version, and pydantic makes heavy use 
    # of checking the current interpreter-version to try to make maximally detailed type-checking.
    #
