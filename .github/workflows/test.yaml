    # Notes on this matrix, particularly the dependencies part:
    # This sets up testing with dependencies from both (a) PyPi and (b) "dev" versions from GitHub.
    # This is particularly relevant for VLSIR, which is often co-developed.
    # Not every version of Hdl21 is designed to work with both.
    # Eventually this should know which *should* work.
    # For now it asserts that the dev-mode passes, and allows failer (`continue-on-error`) for the PyPi version.
